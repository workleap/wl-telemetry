## Monorepo setup

This repository is managed as a monorepo with [PNPM workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to handle the installation of the npm dependencies and manage the packages interdependencies.

It's important to note that PNPM workspace doesn't hoist the npm dependencies at the root of the workspace as most package manager does. Instead, it uses an advanced [symlinked node_modules structure](https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure). This means that you'll find a `node_modules` directory inside the packages folders as well as at the root of the repository.

The main difference to account for is that the `devDependencies` must now be installed locally in every package `package.json` file rather than in the root `package.json` file.

### Turborepo

This repository uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to execute its commands. Turborepo helps save time with its built-in cache but also ensures the packages' topological order is respected when executing commands.

To be understand the relationships between the commands, have a look at this repository [turbo.json](./turbo.json) configuration file.

## Project overview

This project is composed of many packages. Each package is located in the [packages](packages/) directory. These packages represent shared configuration for tools that are used across the Workleap projects.

## Installation

This project uses PNPM workspace, therefore, you must [install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation):

To install the project, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Release the packages

When you are ready to release the packages, you must follow the following steps:
1. Run `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompt. For versioning, always follow the [SemVer standard](https://semver.org/).
2. Commit the newly generated file in your branch and submit a new Pull Request(PR). Changesets will automatically detect the changes and post a message in your pull request telling you that once the PR closes, the versions will be released.
3. Find someone to review your PR.
4. Merge the Pull request into `main`. A GitHub action will automatically trigger and update the version of the packages and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). A tag will also be created on GitHub tagging your PR merge commit.

### Troubleshooting

#### GitHub

Make sure you're Git is clean (No pending changes).

#### npm

Make sure GitHub Action has **write access** to the selected npm packages.

#### Compilation

If the packages failed to compile, it's easier to debug without executing the full release flow every time. To do so, instead, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

By default, packages compilation output will be in their respective *dist* directory.

## Commands

From the project root, you have access to many commands the main ones are:

### build

Build the packages for release.

```bash
pnpm build
```

### test

Run the packages unit tests.

```bash
pnpm test
```

### lint

Lint the packages files & the sample application.

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### changeset

To use when you want to publish a new package version. Will display a prompt to fill in the information about your new release.

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

### clean

Clean the shell packages (delete `dist` folder, clear caches, etc..)

```bash
pnpm clean
```

### reset

Reset the monorepo installation (delete `dist` folders, clear caches, delete `node_modules` folders, etc..)

```bash
pnpm reset
```

### list-outdated-deps

Checks for outdated dependencies. For more information, view [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/cli/outdated).

```bash
pnpm list-outdated-deps
```

### update-outdated-deps

Updated outdated dependencies to their latest version. For more information, view [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/cli/update).

```bash
pnpm update-outdated-deps
```

## CI

We use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for this repository.

You can find the configuration is in the `.github/workflows` folder and the build results are available [here](https://github.com/workleap/wl-web-configs/actions).

We currently have 2 builds configured:

### Changesets

This action runs on a push on the `main` branch. If there is a file present in the `.changeset` folder, it will publish the new package version on npm.

### CI

This action will trigger when a commit is done in a PR to `main` or after a push to `main`. The action will run `build`, `lint` and `test` commands on the source code.

## Add a new package to the monorepo

There are a few steps to add new packages to the monorepo.

Before you add a new package, please read the [GSoft GitHub guidelines](https://github.com/workleap/github-guidelines#npm-package-name).

### Create the package

First, create a new folder matching the package name in the [packages](/packages) directory.

Open a terminal, navigate to the newly created directory, and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm init
```

Answer the CLI questions.

Once the *package.json* is generated, please read again the [GSoft GitHub guidelines](https://github.com/workleap/github-guidelines#npm-package-name) and make sure the package name, author and license are valid.

Don't forget to add the [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes) *"@workleap"* before the package name. For example, if the project name is "foo", your package name should be "@workleap/foo".

Make sure the package publish access is *public* by adding the following to the *package.json* file:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

### Dependencies

npm *dependencies* and *peerDependencies* must be added to the package own *package.json* file.
