# Getting started

Welcome to `@workleap/telemetry`, a collection of telemetry packages for building web applications at Workleap. On this getting started page, you'll find an overview of the project and a list of [supported platforms](#supported-platforms).

## An integrated experience

Without a unified and cohesive telemetry setup, debugging issues or analyzing product behavior often requires **jumping between** tools with **disconnected data**. Session replays in [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/), traces in [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/), and user events in [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) each offer valuable insights, but without shared identifiers or cross-platform context, it becomes difficult to correlate events, reconstruct user journeys, or measure the full impact of a technical issue in production.

This integrated experience brings together LogRocket, Honeycomb, and Mixpanel. By linking session data, performance traces, and user interactions through consistent identifiers, it becomes possible to **trace** a **single** application **event across systems**, from backend performance to frontend behavior to product impact. This integration streamlines will hopefully enables faster, and more informed decision-making.

## A new umbrella package

Although Workleap provides a standalone package for each platform, **we recommend** going forward **using** the `@workleap/telemetry` umbrella package for LogRocket, Honeycomb, and Mixpanel. This simplifies the integration, compared to relying on the individual standalone packages for these. To migrate to the `@workleap/telemetry` umbrella package, refer to the [migration guide](../updating/migrate-to-umbrella-package.md).
