# Getting started

To connect user activity across platforms and provide insight into community engagement and behavior, Workleap has adopted [Common Room](https://www.commonroom.io/), a marketers platform that aggregates data from sources like social media, forums, and product tools to build unified user profiles.

This package provides default Common Room instrumentation for Workleap applications.

## Install the packages

First, open a terminal at the root of the application and install the following packages:

```bash
pnpm add @workleap/common-room
```

## Register instrumentation

Then, register Common Room instrumentation using the [registerCommonRoomInstrumentation](./reference/registerCommonRoomInstrumentation.md) function:

```tsx !#6-8 index.tsx
import { registerCommonRoomInstrumentation } from "@workleap/common-room";
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { App } from "./App.tsx";

registerCommonRoomInstrumentation("my-site-id", {
    verbose: true
});

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);

root.render(
    <StrictMode>
        <App />
    </StrictMode>
);
```

## Identify a user

To associate the anonymous activities with an existing user, identify the current user using the [identify](./reference/identify.md) function:

```ts
import { identify } from "@workleap/common-room";

identify("johndoe@contoso.com");
```

## Try it :rocket:

Start the application in a development environment using the dev script. Go to the "Identify" page and press the button to identify the current user. Then navigate to your [Common Room](https://app.commonroom.io/) instance and go to the "Activity" page, you should see new data appear in the **next 10 minutes**.

### Troubleshoot issues

If you are experiencing issues with this guide:

- Set the [verbose](./reference/registerCommonRoomInstrumentation.md#verbose-mode) predefined option to `true`.
- Open the [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) console and look for logs starting with `[common-room]`.
- Refer to the sample on [GitHub](https://github.com/workleap/wl-telemetry/tree/main/samples/all-platforms).

#### Delete Common Room cookies

If nothing else works, renewing the Common Room cookies with new userId and sessionId values may help.

To do this, open the browserâ€™s developer tools, navigate to `Application` > `Storage` > `Cookies`, select the relevant site, and delete the `signals-sdk-session-id` and `signals-sdk-user-id` cookies.

Finally, refresh the page.
