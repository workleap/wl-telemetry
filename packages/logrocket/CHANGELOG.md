### Major Changes

- [#27](https://github.com/workleap/wl-tracking/pull/27) [`c46c378`](https://github.com/workleap/wl-tracking/commit/c46c3783079835063d1969f547b0d4947d7bd573) Thanks [@patricklafrance](https://github.com/patricklafrance)! - Those new packages provides an integration experience for telemetry. By linking session data, performance traces, and user interactions through consistent identifiers. It becomes possible to trace a single application event across systems, from backend performance to frontend behavior to product impact. This integration streamlines will hopefully enables faster, and more informed decision-making.
