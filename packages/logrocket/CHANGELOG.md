### Major Changes

- [#29](https://github.com/workleap/wl-telemetry/pull/29) [`812f691`](https://github.com/workleap/wl-telemetry/commit/812f691676c60a7748b0db87e38e3b86591e2a85) Thanks [@patricklafrance](https://github.com/patricklafrance)! - Those new packages provides an integration experience for telemetry. By linking session data, performance traces, and user interactions through consistent identifiers. It becomes possible to trace a single application event across systems, from backend performance to frontend behavior to product impact. This integration streamlines will hopefully enables faster, and more informed decision-making.
